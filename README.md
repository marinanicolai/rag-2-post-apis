# 📦 Supply Chain RAG Explorer (React Frontend)

Here's a short prompt for Claude:

*After a plugin submission ("onboarding-context-pack", version 1.0.0) was rejected and deleted from the Admin review queue, re-submitting the same plugin/version now fails with "Version '1.0.0' already exists for plugin 'onboarding-context-pack' — choose a different version." The submission was deleted, so this uniqueness check shouldn't still be blocking it.*

*Investigate the plugin version-uniqueness check and the admin delete/reject action: find whether "deleting" a rejected submission actually removes its row from the table the version-check queries, or just soft-deletes/hides it from the admin UI while leaving it in the database (or leaves an orphaned record behind that the uniqueness constraint still counts). Also check whether "Reject" and "Delete" are two different actions in the admin panel and whether only one of them properly cleans up the record.*

*Fix it so that once a submission is deleted (or, if rejection alone should free up the version, once it's rejected), its plugin/version combination is no longer considered "taken" and the same version can be resubmitted. If there's a legitimate reason to keep rejected submissions around for audit/history, exclude soft-deleted/rejected records from the uniqueness check instead of hard-deleting them — but either way, resubmitting a version after rejection needs to work.*

This repository contains the **React + TypeScript + Vite frontend** for a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system**.  
It allows you to:

- Upload documents (PDF, Word, Excel)
- Ask natural-language questions
- Get AI-generated answers based only on your uploaded data

This repo is meant for **learning, exploring, and experimenting with RAG**, not just as a template UI.

## 🧠 RAG System Architecture

Below is the high-level architecture of the full system (Frontend + Backend + AI Pipeline):

![RAG Architecture](./rag-frontend/src/assets/rag-1.png)

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

* ⚛️ React 19
* 🟦 TypeScript
* ⚡ Vite
* 🎨 Custom dark/green UI
* 🌐 REST API integration (`upload` + `ask`)
* 🧠 RAG Pipeline (via FastAPI backend)
* 🔍 FAISS Vector Database
* 🤖 Groq LLaMA 3.3

---

## 📂 What This Repo Includes

* Upload UI for documents
* Question input & answer panel
* Status messages & error handling
* API connection layer (`src/api.ts`)
* Ready for deployment on **Vercel**

❗ This repo does **not** include the backend.
You must run the FastAPI RAG backend separately.

---

## 🔑 Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

If using a deployed backend (Railway, etc.):

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-url.up.railway.app
```

---

## ▶️ Run Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

# 2. Move into the project
cd your-repo-name

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Start the app
npm run dev
```

Then open:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

Make sure your **FastAPI backend is running at the API URL**.

## 🔄 How the RAG Flow Works

1. User uploads a file
2. Frontend sends it to the FastAPI backend
3. Backend:

   * Chunks the file
   * Creates embeddings
   * Stores them in FAISS
4. User asks a question
5. Backend:

   * Finds the most relevant chunks
   * Sends them to Groq LLaMA
6. AI-generated answer is returned to the UI

---

## 🚀 Deployment

This frontend is optimized for:

* ✅ **Vercel**
* ✅ **Netlify**
* ✅ Any static Vite-compatible host

Build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Output folder:

```bash
dist
```

## 🎯 Who This Is For

* Developers learning **RAG architecture**
* Students exploring **LLMs + vector databases**
* Frontend engineers integrating **real AI systems**
* Anyone building **AI-powered document Q&A**
